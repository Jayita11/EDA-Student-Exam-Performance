# EDA-Student-Performance


## Project Description

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of student performance. The analysis aims to uncover insights and trends in student performance based on various attributes such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation course completion. Additionally, the project includes hypothesis testing to determine the impact of the test preparation course on student performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `StudentsPerformance.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- `gender`: sex of students (Male/Female)
- `race/ethnicity`: ethnicity of students (Group A, B, C, D, E)
- `parental level of education`: parents' final education (bachelor's degree, some college, etc.)
- `lunch`: type of lunch (standard or free/reduced)
- `test preparation course`: whether or not the student completed a test preparation course (none or completed)
- `math score`, `reading score`, `writing score`: scores of students in different subjects

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:
- `EDA_Student_Performance.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the entire exploratory data analysis
- `StudentsPerformance.csv`: Dataset file (ensure it is placed in the specified directory)
- `README.md`: Project documentation file
